# On Silicone Elastomer Buttons

I’m taking about the ones from [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1611), They’re great! They work as advertised, the actuation is [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_rubber_keypad) and the action is satisfying.

For those with OCD, please note: they do not have rotational symmetry.

See:


If you look at the center split, the squares in the center “point up” on the left half, but “down” on the right half. 

When rotated correctly, they all go in the same direction:

So satisfying.
